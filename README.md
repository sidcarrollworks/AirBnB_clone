## Description:
This project is part of a multi-part project over recreating the airbnb web application. Over the course of this project we will learn about data storing, website creation, and database handling. In this specific section we covered basic data storing and manipulation. The console we created can create, save, update, and destroy objects that we have created. The data is serialized and then stored in a file in the directory.

## Usage:
In order to use this you will have to clone the this repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/squidcarroll/AirBnB_clone.git`

Then To use the console just type:

`$ ./console`

To find all the commands you can use type:

`(hbnh) help`

If you want to know how to use the command type:

`(hbnb) help [name of command]`
