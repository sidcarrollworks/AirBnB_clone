## Description:
This project is part of a multi-part project over recreating the airbnb web application. Over the course of this project we will learn about data storing, website creation, and database handling. In this specific section we covered basic data storing and manipulation. The console we created can create, save, update, and destroy objects that we have created. The data is serialized and then stored in a file in the directory.

## Getting Started:
In order to use this you will have to clone the this repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/squidcarroll/AirBnB_clone.git`

Then To use the console just type:

`$ ./console`

## How to use:
To use this console just type and of the given commands in to start storing data.

To find all the commands you can use type:

`(hbnh) help`

If you want to know how to use the command type:

`(hbnb) help [name of command]`

## Examples:
To create a simple base model type:

`(hbnb) create BaseModel`

This will create a base model with a given ID that you can use to do more specific things to that object. This object that you created is now stored in a file named file.json

If you want to update the object use:
`(hbnh) update BaseModel [id] [attribute] "[value]"`
